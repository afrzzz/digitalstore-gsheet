# TODO: Improve Products.jsx Design to be More Professional

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Enhance header section: Add a subtle gradient background, improve typography, and add an icon or better spacing for a more polished look.
- [x] Improve main content area: Add better padding, ensure responsive grid, and introduce a subtle background or border for the product grid.
- [x] Add loading and error handling: Implement a loading spinner while fetching products and display an error message if the fetch fails.
- [x] Refine color scheme and layout: Use more professional colors (e.g., darker grays, better contrasts), add shadows, and ensure the design is clean and modern.
- [ ] Test the changes: Run the app to verify the professional look and responsiveness.

## Dependent Files:

- src/pages/Products.jsx (primary file to edit)

## Followup Steps:
